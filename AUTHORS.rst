  AUTHORS
===========

* Dylan W. Schwilk (http://www.schwilk.org) wrote a simple version of the
  bibstuff library around 2005.
* Alan Isaac (https://subversion.american.edu/aisaac/isaac1.htm) encouraged
  moving the code to a public repository and contributed significant
  enhancements and additions including some major refactoring and better
  ReStructured Text integration. Isaac wrote/rewrote much of the current code base.
* Matthew Brett forked the project onto GitHub
  (https://github.com/matthew-brett/bibstuff) and added a sphinx extension.
  Although that submodule is omitted from this repo version, several commits
  and fixes by Brett, Yaroslav Halchenko and Matthias C. M. Troffaes have
  been merged into this repository.
